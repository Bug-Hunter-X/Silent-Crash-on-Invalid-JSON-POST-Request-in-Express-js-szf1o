This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in Express.js applications: the silent failure when receiving malformed JSON data in POST requests.  The `bug.js` file showcases the vulnerable code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a robust solution incorporating comprehensive error handling.

**Problem:** The application lacks middleware to handle cases where the incoming request body (`req.body`) is not properly parsed as JSON.  This can occur if the client sends non-JSON data or if there's an issue with the JSON parsing itself.  The result is a server crash without informative error messages.

**Solution:** The solution includes the use of a global error handler to catch JSON parsing errors and other potential issues, providing more informative error messages to the client.  This prevents unexpected crashes and improves application stability and debuggability.
